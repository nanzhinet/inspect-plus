description: Use for inspect-plus architecture decisions that must keep `offical` easy to merge while isolating Plus behavior. Apply when touching `src/views`, `src/views/plus`, `src/components/plus`, `src/composables/plus`, `src/utils/plus`, routing overrides, or any Base/Plus decoupling work.

# Inspect Plus Architecture

This skill governs how to evolve `inspect-plus` without making future merges from `offical` painful.

For command execution, TODO handling, and browser verification, pair this skill with `inspect-plus-workflow`.

## Goal

Keep official code mergeable.
Keep Plus features isolated.
Avoid copy-paste forks of official views and components.

## Source-of-truth rules

1. `offical` is the upstream compatibility baseline.
2. `src/views/*` should stay as close to official as possible.
3. `src/views/plus/*` should be wrappers, not forks.
4. Plus-only logic belongs in `src/composables/plus/*`, `src/utils/plus/*`, or `src/components/plus/*`.
5. If a feature can be injected with props, slots, or one-line hooks, do that instead of rewriting the base file.

## File ownership

- Base views:
  - `src/views/DevicePage.vue`
  - `src/views/home/HomePage.vue`
  - `src/views/snapshot/*`
- Plus wrappers:
  - `src/views/plus/*`
- Plus business UI:
  - `src/components/plus/*`
- Plus feature logic:
  - `src/composables/plus/*`
- Plus helpers:
  - `src/utils/plus/*`

Do not move official logic into `plus` just because it is large.
Do move Plus-only logic out of base views when it reduces merge conflicts.

## Mandatory architecture check before editing

1. Compare against official first.
   - Use `git diff --name-status offical..main`
   - Prefer targeted diffs for the file being changed.
   - Use `git diff offical..main -- src/ > src.diff` when you need a wider repo view.
2. Classify each change:
   - `official-compatible`: likely acceptable in base
   - `plus-only`: must live in plus layer
   - `mixed`: split before continuing
3. Prefer the smallest viable seam:
   - slot
   - prop
   - emitted event
   - wrapper component
   - composable
4. Only patch base files at stable seam points.

## Allowed base-file changes

These are the preferred kinds of base edits:

- Add slot outlets
- Add prop-driven extension points
- Extract shared logic into neutral composables
- Replace hard-coded UI sections with child components
- Add small guards for null safety or performance
- Add import path indirection needed for wrappers
- Use generic, neutral names for slots and props
  - Prefer names like `extra-content`, `item-footer`, `toolbar-right`
  - Avoid project-specific names like `plus-*`

These are discouraged:

- Copying an entire official file into `src/views/plus` and editing it heavily
- Re-implementing the same computed/watch logic in both base and plus
- Adding Plus-only branches deep inside official templates
- Mixing Plus styles into official component internals without a wrapper seam
- Adding convenience code that speeds up the current task but increases future merge conflicts

## Wrapper design pattern

When Plus needs to enhance a page:

1. Keep the base page responsible for core layout and official behavior.
2. Create or keep a wrapper under `src/views/plus`.
3. Inject extra UI through slots or thin child components.
4. Put Plus state and side effects into a `useXxxPlus.ts` composable.
5. Keep wrapper templates small and obvious.

### The "Seam First" Rule

If a base file is too rigid for injection, first refactor the base file to introduce a seam such as a slot, prop, or event in a separate commit before implementing the Plus feature.

Target shape:

- base page: stable composition surface
- plus wrapper: glue code only
- plus composable: feature state and side effects
- plus component: isolated enhanced UI

## Conflict minimization rules

When deciding where code should go, use this order:

1. `src/composables/plus/*`
2. `src/components/plus/*`
3. `src/utils/plus/*`
4. wrapper under `src/views/plus/*`
5. minimal seam patch in base view

If a change would duplicate more than roughly 20 percent of an official file, stop and refactor the seam first.

If a Plus view grows into a near-copy of a base view, treat that as architecture debt and split it before adding new features.

Long-term maintainability rule:

- Prefer a slightly slower but cleaner seam-first refactor over a quick copy-paste fork.
- Do not add "temporary" spaghetti branches that are likely to survive into later rounds.

Type augmentation rule:

- Do not modify official `.d.ts` files for Plus-only extensions
- Use TypeScript declaration merging or module augmentation under `src/types/plus/*`
- Keep base type surfaces upstream-friendly and put local extensions in the Plus layer

## Styling rules

1. Do not restyle official pages directly unless needed for a seam.
2. Plus styling should live in Plus components or wrapper-scoped `:deep(...)` overrides.
3. Prefer CSS variables from `src/style/var.scss`.
4. Avoid hard-coded layout values when a reusable variable is possible.
5. Do not optimize one floating window or panel while leaving sibling UI inconsistent.
6. Check both light and dark readability when changing color, focus, or emphasis styles.
7. Favor responsive-friendly tokens over fixed one-off values so mobile adaptation stays possible.

## Import rules

1. In Plus files, prefer `@/` aliases for official imports.
2. Do not use fragile deep relative imports to reach official files from Plus folders.
3. Keep file names and import case exact.

## Review checklist

Before finishing a refactor, verify:

- Is the base file still close to `offical`?
- Is Plus logic isolated from official logic?
- Did we remove duplication instead of moving it around?
- Can the feature survive an upstream merge with minimal manual conflict resolution?
- Are Plus imports using stable `@/` aliases?
- Did we avoid adding a second source of truth?

## High-risk areas in this repo

Prioritize mirror-code cleanup in:

- `src/views/plus/home/HomePage.vue`
- `src/views/plus/DevicePage.vue`
- `src/views/plus/snapshot/RuleCard.vue`
- `src/views/plus/snapshot/SearchCard.vue`
- `src/views/plus/snapshot/WindowCard.vue`

These files are likely to conflict with future upstream changes and should trend toward wrapper-plus-composable architecture instead of full forks.
